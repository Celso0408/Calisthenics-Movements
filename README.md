# ðŸ’ª Calisthenics-Movements

<h3>ðŸ”§Developing</h3>

#### It is a web application planned by me, where I perform the CRUD of Calisthenics Movements.

<h3>Some fields in main Model is:</h3>

+ name.
+ description.
+ repetation num.
+ sequency num.
+ dificult category.

<h3>In addition to CRUD, I implement other features such as:</h3>

+ search for movements by name and/or dificulted category.
+ analyze details of an isolated movement.
+ entire verification system to validate forms with personalized messages.
