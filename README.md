# Calisthenics-Movements

<h3>Developing</h3>

It is a web application planned by me, where I perform the CRUD of Calisthenics Movements.

<h5>Some fields in main Model is:</h5>

+ name.
+ description.
+ repetation num.
+ sequency num.
+ dificult category.

<h5>In addition to CRUD, I implement other features such as:</h5>

+ search for movements by name and/or dificult category.
+ analyze details of an isolation movement.
+ entire verification system to validate forms with personalized messages.
