# Calisthenics-Movements
&lt;h1>Developing&lt;/h1>It is a web application planned by me, where I perform the CRUD of Calisthenics Movements, some fields in main Model is: name, description, repetation num, sequency num and dificult category. In addition to CRUD, I implement other features such as: search for movements by name and/or dificult category, analyze details of an isolation movement and the entire verification system to validate forms with personalized messages.
